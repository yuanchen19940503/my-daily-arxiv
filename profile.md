# Research Profile (for arXiv relevance ranking)

## One-sentence summary
I work on gravitational-wave signals and stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds related to primordial black holes (PBHs), accretion / environment effects, and related astrophysical/cosmological sources.

## Core interests (high priority)
- Primordial black holes: formation, accretion, motion in halos, ringdown, SGWB
- Stochastic GW background: PTA / LISA / ground-based detectability, spectral shapes, forecasts
- Waveform / spectrum modeling: GRMHD-informed spectra, semi-analytic models, data-driven constraints

## Methods / tools I use
- Analytical modeling of GW spectra (Omega_GW), scaling laws
- Numerical relativity / ringdown modeling (when relevant)
- GRMHD simulations / post-processing (BHAC etc.)
- Parameter inference / detectability forecasts (SNR, sensitivities, etc.)

## What I consider “relevant”
- New theory/modeling directly applicable to PBH-related GW signals or SGWB
- Detectability studies in PTA/LISA/LIGO bands with concrete predictions
- Papers that provide new mechanisms, new constraints, or new waveform features

## What is usually “not relevant”
- Generic GW data analysis not connected to PBH/SGWB topics
- Pure dark energy / modified gravity papers unless they explicitly discuss GW observables I care about

## Keywords I care about (optional)
PBH, primordial black hole, ringdown, stochastic gravitational-wave background, SGWB, Omega_GW, PTA, LISA, Kerr, accretion, halo, induced GW

## Representative papers / notes (optional)
- <paste 1–3 abstracts of your own work or short summaries>
