# Research Profile (for arXiv relevance ranking)

## One-sentence summary
I work on primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational waves (GWs) and black hole environment, with a focus on stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWB), scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW), and PBH-driven phenomenology, especially GW signatures across PTA/LVK/LISA bands.

## Primary research themes (high priority)
- **PBH ↔ GW connection**: GW signals and SGWB sourced by PBHs; PBH interpretations of LVK events (including mass-gap/sub-solar candidates).
- **Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs)**: modeling, spectrum features, non-Gaussian effects, and robust theoretical aspects (including gauge issues).
- **PBH formation and abundance constraints**: enhanced curvature perturbations, spectator fields, and constraints on the PBH fraction or PBH abundance from PBH-related phenomenology, e.g., high-energy photons or neutrinos emitted by PBHs, micro-lensing..
- **Observational interfaces**: forecasts and constraints relevant to LVK/PTA/LISA; connecting theoretical predictions to detector sensitivity.

## Current / near-term directions (very high priority)
- **BH or PBH environment & astrophysical processes**: GW effects from BH or PBH accretion and relativistic accretion physics; disk-driven GW signatures and related modeling.
- **PBH evolution in cosmic history**: toward more realistic PBH population evolution including mergers, accretion, and reconstruction of mass function and spin distribution.

## Secondary / lower-priority interests
- Ultralight bosons, black-hole superradiance, and related near-horizon physics (previous focus; still relevant if directly tied to GW observables, but not my main direction now).

## Methods & tools I use / value
- Analytical and semi-analytical modeling of GW spectra.
- SIGW calculations, e.g., gauge, non-Gaussianities, higher order.
- Phenomenology linking PBH scenarios to LVK/PTA/LISA observations (event interpretation, constraints, detectability).
- Numerical / simulation-informed modeling when relevant (e.g., relativistic accretion / GRMHD-informed ingredients; planned N-body style PBH population evolution).

## What I consider highly relevant
- Any paper that provides **new PBH-related GW/SGWB mechanisms**, **new constraints**, or **new detectable predictions** (PTA/LVK/LISA).
- SIGW papers that address **formation**, **non-Gaussianity**, **gauge**, or **data analysis**.
- PBH population studies that include **mass & spin evolution**, **merger**, **accretion**, or **SMBH-seed connections**.
- Ringdown / QNM / memory-burden signatures **when tied to PBHs or PBH-motivated scenarios**.

## Usually not relevant (deprioritize)
- Modified gravity / dark energy papers unless they make concrete GW-observable predictions directly connected to my interests.
- Ultralight boson/superradiance papers that do not connect to GW observables or constraints.

- PBH interpretation of LVK candidate events (including mass-gap/sub-solar regimes).
- SIGW theory and robustness (gauge issues; induced/secondary GW formalism).
- SIGW constraints on PBH abundance from PTA data.
- GW signatures from accretion disks (turbulence/mode excitation) and prospects for future detectors.

- Rank by relevance to my PBH↔GW/SGWB/SIGW interests.
- Prefer papers with concrete predictions, constraints, or new mechanisms over purely formal developments.
- Provide 1–2 sentence rationale for each top-ranked paper highlighting why it matches my profile.
